    \subsubsection{Grassland compost amendments increase plant production
without changing plant
communities}\label{grassland-compost-amendments-increase-plant-production-without-changing-plant-communities}

\emph{Review of article by Rebecca Ryals Valerie T. Eviner Claudia Stein
Katharine N. Suding Whendee L. Silver}
https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.1270

\textbf{impacts of compost amendment over 4 years on plant dynamics in
two grazed grassland ecosystems in California: a coastal prairie and
valley grassland}

results: - large persistent increases in aboveground biomass -
cobenefits to grassland plant dynamics - "few studies have explored
potential trade‐offs or cobenefits associated with management strategies
that promote C sequestration" - hypothesized that grasslands would be
resistant to shifts in community composition and increases in the
abundances of secondary invaders, C. lanatus and E. caput‐medusae
following compost amendment

questions: - how do we know that this entails a meaningful difference
towards atmospheric effects? - are the treatment / control groups
comparable? - data collection: how many acres? is this study limited
just to California? what data is accessible? - can we quantify how much
carbon is being sequestered? - \textbf{can we actually make
projections?}

    \paragraph{Data Exploration}\label{data-exploration}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  both grasslands are in northern california, rainfall had SD of
  \textasciitilde{}200 mm / yr for the 4 years
\item
  similar soil texture at both sites
\item
  treatment / control groups in same farm. simple treatment: thin
  surface of compost
\item
  measurements 24h before/after grazing
\item
  0.4 acre plots
\end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Plots}\label{plots}

    \paragraph{Fig 1}\label{fig-1}

"Significant treatment differences in pregrazed aboveground biomass were
detected at both grassland sites within the first year following the
compost application"

"At the time of grazing, composted plots contained an average of 100 ±
16 and 128 ± 6 g·m−2·y−1 more aboveground biomass in the valley
grassland and coastal prairie, respectively"

Compost was applied once - is it a significant result that there doesn't
seem to be a change in ratio of pre-grazed aboveground biomass for
treatment vs. control as years progress?

Clear differences in grazing behavior between valley grassland and
coastal prairie. Is there a way to account for this?

    

    \paragraph{Fig 2}\label{fig-2}

"Compost amendments significantly affected plant N content. For compost
treatments, plant N content of pregrazed biomass was significantly
greater at both sites for all 4 yr of the study"

"The effect of compost amendments on aboveground plant N concentration
was not consistent"

What do inconsistencies in treatment differences for N concentration
mean? Does this detract from the value of the increased N content?

    

    \paragraph{Fig 5: Compost treatment effect of common
species}\label{fig-5-compost-treatment-effect-of-common-species}

Valley grassland seems to show significant changes from compost
treatment, whereas variation has heteroskedasticity in the coastal
prairie.

"We hypothesized that the grasslands in our study, which are dominated
by exotic annual species, would be relatively resistant to shifts in
community composition with a one‐time compost amendment... Species
richness varied significantly over the 4‐yr study, but showed little
effect of compost amendments. The abundance of native species did not
change, and the overall species composition remained similar at each
site over time."

\emph{This statement makes sense for the valley grassland, but is it
applicable to the coastal prairie?}

    

    \subsubsection{Implications of analysis}\label{implications-of-analysis}

Any mention of atmospheric effects from the compost amendments come from
references to other papers. At the same time, the authors say " Amending
rangelands with compost is a relative new approach, and the impact of
its use on grassland communities is not well known. Contrary to the
general assumption from conventional practices, our data from two
rangeland types suggests that a single compost addition can enhance
several ecosystem services consistently through time. These results
suggest that compost amendment to rangelands may provide ecosystem
services, including C storage and enhanced forage production, without
adversely altering plant communities."

"The lack of major shifts in vegetation or prolonged responses of
noxious species suggests that there are few trade‐offs between C
sequestration and plant diversity in these grasslands."

The simple experimental design of this paper provides solid evidence of
how the specific grasslands responded to compost amendments, but it's
not clear what kind of effect these practices have on the atmosphere.
The data is not provided, so the work isn't replicable at all.
