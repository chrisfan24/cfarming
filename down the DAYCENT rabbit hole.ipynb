    "- \"we advocate using more complex models when possible to estimate C and nutrient flows because they are likely to yield more reliable results and because they more realistically represent how land management practices interact with each other and environmental factors to control these fluxes. In particular, DayCent accounts for the interactions and feedbacks between management practices such as tillage intensity, irrigation, and fertilizer additions, as well as environmental factors such as soil type and weather.\"\n",

    "- \"Soil C levels are a function of C inputs from plant litter and organic matter amendments and C losses from decomposition of litter and organic matter. High quality litter and organic matter decompose more quickly and contribute less than low quality litter and organic matter to the stable soil C pools. Litter quality is a function of N concentration and the lignin/N ratio of material. Carbon losses from decomposition are a function of soil texture and cultivation. As soils become coarser textured, a higher portion of C in material is assumed to be lost as CO2 during each stage of the decomposition process. Cultivation events affect decomposition by incorporating surface biomass and litter into the soil and by enhancing decomposition rates. **Operationally, users define the portions of aboveground litter and biomass that will be mixed into the soil, the extent to which disturbance events enhance decomposition rates of the SOM pools, and the time period during which decomposition will be enhanced.**\"\n",

Errors associated with uncertainty in model drivers can be assessed by performing a series of Monte Carlo simulations in which model drivers are acquired by drawing from probability distribution functions for each model driver. Errors resulting from imperfections in model algorithms and parameters can be quantified by comparing model outputs with observed values from field experiments... **Recent analysis showed the majority of error in DayCent model outputs is due to imperfections in model algorithms and parameters, as opposed to uncertainty in model drivers**\"\n",

    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as I've searched I haven't been able to find a study that tests soil organic carbon levels from DAYcent simulations with field study results. Rather, parameters, which are computed with submodels, such as temperature and water content are tested against simulations, and these parameters are inputted into the model. R^2 values for these parameters seem to lie around 0.7, which, when used as a parameter for carbon farming dynamics, would theoretically lead to lower R^2 values. However, Del Grosso states that most of the error from the model comes from model algorithm imperfections rather than model drivers. Users also tone the parameters based on their own judgment, so this leads to higher variation.  \n",
