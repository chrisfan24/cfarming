    "### Implications of analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Any mention of atmospheric effects from the compost amendments come from references to other papers. At the same time, the authors say \" Amending rangelands with compost is a relative new approach, and the impact of its use on grassland communities is not well known. Contrary to the general assumption from conventional practices, our data from two rangeland types suggests that a single compost addition can enhance several ecosystem services consistently through time. These results suggest that compost amendment to rangelands may provide ecosystem services, including C storage and enhanced forage production, without adversely altering plant communities.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The lack of major shifts in vegetation or prolonged responses of noxious species suggests that there are few trade‐offs between C sequestration and plant diversity in these grasslands.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple experimental design of this paper provides solid evidence of how the specific grasslands responded to compost amendments, but it's not clear what kind of effect these practices have on the atmosphere. The data is not provided, so the work isn't replicable at all. "
